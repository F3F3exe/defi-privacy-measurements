These are all the dapp urls (grouped by their category) that I filtered to only contain valid and reachable websites. Further, 
I tried to find all the actual 'app' urls. There are quite a lot that are refer to e.g. 'opensea' or
require a login with email and password, especially for the categories 'high-risk' and 'gambling'.

I did run roughly 3/4 of the 'marketplace' category and got a leak percentace of 25%. 

Note that I still have the category 'other' left to do.
